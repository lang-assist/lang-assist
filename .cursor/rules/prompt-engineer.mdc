# BrocaAgent Platform Overview

BrocaAgent is an AI-powered platform that transforms language learning into a personalized and interactive experience. The platform continuously analyzes users' language skills to create custom learning materials tailored to each individual user. User's can also has own dictionary and documentation. Users can learn language in a way they want.

## Learning Cycle

User interacts with a material, feedback engine generates feedback. analysis engine analyzes user responses, next material is generated based on updated profile. There are also dictionary and documentation engines.

The platform creates a personalized learning path for each user: Materials are kept slightly above current level (5-10%), Strengths are reinforced while weaknesses are developed, Learning pace and style adapt to the user, Cultural context and user interests are considered.

Each generated material is optimized according to these criteria: Age and level appropriateness, Cultural sensitivity, Learning objective alignment, Interaction quality, Pedagogical value

# Documents Structure

All prompts in `./bin/server/tools/prompts`:

```
prompts/
├── parts.json         # Configuration file defining prompt parts and their combinations
├── shared/            # Shared prompt components used across multiple generators
├── generators/        # Generator-specific prompt components
├── old/               # Archived prompt components
└── README.md          # This documentation file
```

## Adding New Components

To add a new prompt component:

1. Create a new html file in the appropriate directory (`shared/` or `generators/`)

# Prompt Writing Principles

1 - Prompts should be as short as possible, while still including all the necessary information.
2 - No unnecessary styling elements should be used. Prompt will not be read by a human. 
3 - They are written for all situations, not individual.
4 - Dont use json blocks, json schemas already given the LLM's, prompts only describe that what fields filled with what etc.
5 - No unnecessary bullet points. Use like : "a point, another point, third point etc"
6 - All shared prompts wrapped with a xml tag like (<picture_prompt_guildelines>)
7 - You can reference another tag with <tag> (e.g. <picture_prompt_guildelines>);

Structure of prompts:

## Xml format

### Root tags:

<role>: The role of the assistant

<task>: The task instructions. No context dependent information.

<context>: The context of the task. Given by server.

<request>: The main request of the task. Given by server.

### Sub tags:

#### task tag:

Task tag includes <input> and <output> tags.

#### context tag:

Context tag includes:
<journey>: The journey of the user, target language, current language, user name, etc.
<level>: The level of the user.
<observation>: The observations inlcudes <general>, <weaknesses>, <strengths>.

If any:
<stage>: The current stage summary. Exept stage generator, this tag is required.
<previous_stage>: The previous stages summaries. Stage generator uses this.

### Global Tags:

<avoid>: Things to avoid.
<do>: Things to do.
<example>: Examples. For json examples, use <example in-yaml> tags and write it in yaml format.
